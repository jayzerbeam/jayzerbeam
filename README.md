## 👾 Welcome to my Github profile 👾

If I'm not committing here, I'm committing to my Georgia Tech student Github account. University policy requires student repositories to be private, so here's a snapshot of my commit history:

### 💻 I'm currently working on... 💻

At GaTech: [Game Artificial Intelligence](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7632-game-ai). 

At home: The University of Helsinki's [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). I've primarily worked on web application front ends (JavaScript, VueJS, ReactJS), but the entire stack is interesting to me. Programming resources are a dime a dozen on the web, so it's important to find quality resources. I've found this course to be top-notch.

### 🪐 Future work 🪐

I plan to take [Computer Networks](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks) at Georgia Tech next semester. 

After I complete the Full Stack Open course, I'd like to contribute more often to Open Source projects on Github and to work through the classic [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/). I've already started the latter, but have paused it due to time constraints.

## Welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘¾

If I'm not committing here, I'm committing to my Georgia Tech student Github account. University policy requires student repositories to be private, so here's a snapshot of my commit history:

### I'm currently working on...

At GaTech: [Game Artificial Intelligence](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7632-game-ai). 

At home: The University of Helsinki's [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). I've primarily worked on web application front ends (JavaScript, VueJS, ReactJS), but the entire stack is interesting to me. Programming resources are a dime a dozen on the web, so it's important to find quality resources. I've found this course to be top-notch.
